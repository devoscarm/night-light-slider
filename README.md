## Acknoledgments

I'm thrilled to share my first GNOME extension and contribute to the amazing FOSS world!
This project wouldn't have been possible without the incredible open-source community, which
has taught me so much over the years.

I take this opportunity to thank the communities of **Ubuntu**, **Debian**, and **GNOME** for 
their invaluable forums, documentation and discussions. Your knowledge, generosity, and passion
continue to inspire me every day.

To all open-source contributors out there - **thank you for making technology accessible, 
transparent, and truly collaborative!** ðŸš€
